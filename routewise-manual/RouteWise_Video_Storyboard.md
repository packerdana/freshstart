# RouteWise — Video-First Storyboard (Begin Tour → End Tour)

Style: **friendly + a little funny**, animated explainer.  
Target device vibe: **iPhone** (but visuals are simplified/animated, not screenshots).

---

## How to use this doc
Each section is a **scene** (think: one slide).  
NotebookLM video prompt tip: *“Use each scene title as an on-screen chapter card. Keep on-screen text short. Animate simple icons and timelines.”*

---

# Scene 0 — Cold Open (5 seconds)
**On-screen title:** RouteWise in one sentence

**Visual:** iPhone outline → RouteWise logo → a clock icon + a mail tray icon.

**Narration:**
“RouteWise helps you predict your day, track your time codes, and—most importantly—avoid accidentally poisoning your own data.”

---

# Scene 1 — The Big Rule (the app’s secret sauce)
**On-screen title:** Clean days = good predictions

**Visual:** Two jars:
- Jar A labeled “Clean Days” → becomes a smooth prediction line
- Jar B labeled “Messy Days” → becomes a chaotic scribble

**Narration:**
“RouteWise learns from your history. If the history is clean, predictions get scary good. If it’s messy… the app will confidently lie to you.”

**Common mistake → fix:**
- Mistake: Forgetting to mark assistance.
- Fix: Use Assistance mode + skip the rest of the route.

---

# Scene 2 — Setup (one time)
**On-screen title:** Setup your route once

**Visual:** Simple form fields:
- Route #
- Start time
- Tour length
- Lunch

**Narration:**
“First time only: create your route. Get your start time and tour length right—that’s your foundation.”

**On-screen bullets (short):**
- Route Number
- Start Time
- Tour Length (ex: 8.5)
- Lunch (30)

---

# Scene 3 — Waypoints: what they are
**On-screen title:** Waypoints = checkpoints

**Visual:** A ladder with rungs labeled #0 #1 #2 … #98 #99.

**Narration:**
“Waypoints are your checkpoints. They power live expected times and help you know if you’re ahead or behind.”

---

# Scene 4 — Quick Setup anchors (do this first)
**On-screen title:** Quick Setup: the 4 anchors

**Visual:** Four big cards:
- #0 Leave Post Office
- #1 1st Stop
- #98 Last Stop
- #99 Return to Post Office

**Narration:**
“Quick Setup creates four anchor points. These are the backbone of your day.”

**Common mistake → fix:**
- Mistake: Only tracking street time without anchors.
- Fix: Always run Quick Setup.

---

# Scene 5 — Add your own waypoints (unlimited)
**On-screen title:** Add as many as you want

**Visual:** + button → list grows: “123 Main”, “Apartment cluster”, “Business loop”…

**Narration:**
“Add any waypoint you care about. RouteWise will pick the next sequence number automatically. No math required.”

---

# Scene 6 — Begin Tour: enter mail volumes
**On-screen title:** Begin Tour: enter volumes

**Visual:** Five floating counters:
- DPS
- Flats
- Letters
- Parcels
- SPRs / Scanner Total

**Narration:**
“Before you hit the street, enter what you know. Consistent is better than perfect.”

**Callout:**
“If you only have Scanner Total, that still counts.”

---

# Scene 7 — Where to find packages (without stress)
**On-screen title:** Packages: pick one source

**Visual:** Three options icons:
- Scanner total
- Load Truck
- Clerk/manifest

**Narration:**
“Packages can come from different places. The trick is: pick one reliable source and stick with it.”

---

# Scene 8 — Start 721 (leaving the office)
**On-screen title:** Start 721 when you LEAVE

**Visual:** Timeline bar:
- 722 AM Office → (tap) → 721 Street

**Narration:**
“When you physically leave the office, hit Start Route. That starts 721—and it also captures your Leave Office time.”

**Friendly warning:**
“Don’t start it while you’re still chatting at the case. Unless you like lying to your own stats.”

---

# Scene 9 — Live expected times (how they work)
**On-screen title:** Expected times go LIVE

**Visual:**
- “Expected: 10:05” changes to “Expected: 9:59 (live)” after completing a waypoint.

**Narration:**
“After you complete real waypoints, expected times adjust live. Ahead? They move earlier. Behind? They move later.”

---

# Scene 10 — Forgot a waypoint? (no shame)
**On-screen title:** Missed a tap? Use “Forgot?”

**Visual:** A missed waypoint card → “Forgot?” button → choose time → fixed.

**Narration:**
“If you forgot to tap Complete, use ‘Forgot?’ Fix it quickly without wrecking your history.”

---

# Scene 11 — Assistance day (the #1 data poisoner)
**On-screen title:** Assistance day = mark it

**Visual:** A hazard icon + a split route map:
- You do early part
- Someone else does the rest

**Narration:**
“If you give away part of your route, you MUST mark it. Otherwise RouteWise learns the wrong lesson.”

---

# Scene 12 — Give away the rest: skip remaining waypoints
**On-screen title:** Skip remaining (assistance)

**Visual:**
- Prompt: “Last waypoint YOU delivered?”
- Everything after turns gray: “Skipped (assistance)”

**Narration:**
“Gave away the rest? Hit ‘Skip remaining.’ Tell RouteWise where you stopped. Everything after gets marked skipped—so it won’t poison predictions.”

**Rule (big text):**
“If you didn’t deliver it, don’t complete it.”

---

# Scene 13 — Return to Post Office waypoint
**On-screen title:** Return to PO: only if YOU returned

**Visual:** Two paths:
- Path A: you return → complete #99
- Path B: you gave it away → #99 skipped

**Narration:**
“Only complete Return to Post Office if you actually returned. If someone else finished, skip it.”

---

# Scene 14 — End Tour: complete the day
**On-screen title:** End Tour: finish strong

**Visual:** Checklist card:
- Actual street time
- Clock-out time
- Assistance minutes (if any)
- Notes

**Narration:**
“At End Tour, record the actuals. This is what makes tomorrow’s prediction better than today’s.”

---

# Scene 15 — Stats: what matters
**On-screen title:** Stats that actually help

**Visual:**
- Prediction Accuracy chart (predicted vs actual)
- Day History card (722+721+744−30)

**Narration:**
“Two things to watch: prediction accuracy, and day history totals. That’s how you know the app is learning the right lesson.”

---

# Scene 16 — The 3 most common mistakes
**On-screen title:** Avoid these 3 traps

**Visual:** Three red cards:
1) Wrong link/domain
2) Unmarked assistance
3) Refresh confusion

**Narration:**
“If something looks missing, don’t panic. Most ‘bugs’ are these three traps—and they’re fixable.”

---

# Scene 17 — Close
**On-screen title:** Make RouteWise smarter every day

**Visual:** Prediction line smoothing out over time.

**Narration:**
“Clean days in, great predictions out. That’s the game. Now go crush Begin Tour—then End Tour like a pro.”

---

## Add-on scenes (optional)
- “What to do if today’s inputs disappear” (domain + app version + refresh)
- “How to handle a day-after-holiday monster day” (notes + don’t panic)
- “What ‘clean day’ means” (no assistance, no mail brought back, etc.)
