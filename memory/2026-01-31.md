- Dana priorities for RouteWise:
  - #1 accurately predict office + street time (waypoint predictions already super close)
  - Wants "really cool stats" that are useful + fun for carriers
  - Stress points: morning go-around (supervisor pressure on return time), and on-street confidence about being ahead/behind estimate
- Carrier language preference: time predictions must be shown/printed as real time (hours:minutes, e.g. 4:30) — not decimals (e.g. 4.50)
- Paperwork reality: the most important paperwork is the morning 3996; usually no paperwork when they get back
  - App should support both quick check-in and full logbook styles
  - Ranking: prediction accuracy > paperwork > protect carriers/rights (good first two should cover last)
- Dana uses Android.
- Dana is getting back into shape with resistance training: strength + fat loss, 3 days/week.

- Ahead/Behind feature spec (Dana decisions):
  - Compare pace vs historical average (not waypoint plan)
  - Baseline: last 10 days, same day type (Monday vs normal)
  - Exclude days with aux help, mail not delivered, and NS days (when tracked)
  - Time-based, measured from leave office time (721 start)
  - Update only when user hits waypoints
