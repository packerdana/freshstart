- Dana asked to remember which tools from a YouTube list are useful for managing/marketing/growing RouteWise and to suggest them when relevant.
- Recommended (use now): Descript, Gamma, Make (make.com), SocialSweep, ChatGPT/Claude for copy/FAQs/support scripts (non-coding).
- Maybe later: ElevenLabs, NotebookLM, Membership.io.

## Moltbot/Mac mini setup note for tomorrow
- Dana asked: "Remember this tomorrow when we setup on the Mac Mini."
- Recommendation: keep Moltbot + RouteWise setup mostly as-is (stable), with GPT-5.2/Codex as primary.
- Optional: use Kimi/Claude/ChatGPT separately for non-coding "brain/copy" work and paste into Moltbot, instead of adding many providers/models to Moltbot config.
- Only consider adding extra providers/models to Moltbot if daily limits block work or Dana wants automatic cheap brain tasks.
