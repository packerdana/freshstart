- RouteWise: Boxholder feature idea — add Today screen checkbox "Cased boxholder?" (next to boxholder). Only show this option if route setup has # of stops entered (to avoid confusing users). If checked, ask letter vs flat; then credit +stops pieces into the same letters/flats piece totals used for feet→pieces and Office Time Breakdown.
