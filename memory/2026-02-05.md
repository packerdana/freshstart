## Notes / RouteWise

- Steward-ready script (phone appearance concern while casing/pulling down):
  1) “Understood—what’s the approved on-the-clock method for recording my volumes for route documentation?”
  2) “Do you want me to use a paper log or a USPS/NALC form?”
  3) “Can you provide the instruction in writing so I follow it consistently?”

- Context: Carrier concern management may think volume entry on personal phone looks like texting in office. Goal: keep it work-related, consistent policy, avoid off-the-clock work.

- Idea to keep: Create a 1-page in-app PDF/handout: “If management questions phone entry while casing/pulling down” with:
  - JCAM 41.3.H (reasonable policy / telephone access) excerpt
  - JCAM 41.3.K (off-the-clock work prohibited) excerpt
  - Just-cause/discipline due-process framing (Defenses to Discipline / investigation before discipline)
  - Safe ‘Paper Mode’ fallback.
  Dana liked this idea and wants it remembered + to be reminded if it comes up again.
