- Investigated carrier ddmjwilson@gmail.com (Route 26) with early morning predictions.
- Found suspicious Supabase route_history entry: 2026-01-24 street_time=5 minutes (likely invalid/partial day).
- Added app-side prediction guard: ignore obviously invalid street times (<120 minutes; cap at 16h) when building averages (packerdana-freshstart commit 78a42fb).
- Added admin-helper edge function endpoints:
  - route-history (fetch history + anomaly flags)
  - route-history-delete (delete a specific day)
  - Fixed edge function errors and improved secret-missing messaging.
- After redeploy, successfully deleted 2026-01-24 for ddmjwilson@gmail.com Route 26; confirmed removed from history.
- Plan: check his predictions tomorrow to see if improved.
- Checked rebecca.a.lotz@gmail.com Route 004: no suspicious street times.
- Checked packerdana@gmail.com Route 25: found 2026-01-30 office_time=511, overtime=454; deleted that day via admin-helper; confirmed removed.
- Dana shared a reference video showing how a carrier can pull up their total packages from the USPS scanner (for future support/docs).
- Dana wants to set up a Windows laptop (Surface Pro 8) to run Larry/Moltbot. Note: using Chrome on the Linux box locks it up for Dana (Chrome locks/freezes), so prefer Windows-side control solutions.
